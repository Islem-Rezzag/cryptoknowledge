    <h2>How to choose a cryptocurrency</h2><br>
    <p class="par1">Today, cryptocurrencies are arguably the hottest investment product currently available, but still somewhat of a geeky trend not understood by most people. And that is exactly why you should learn about it and consider investing in it. Jumping on the bandwagon earlier than most will give you an edge, both in terms of experience and potential profits. To wit, this book will help teach you the nuts and bolts of cryptocurrency, including its history, technology, regulations and economics. Most importantly, you will learn sound investment strategies that already work along with the spectrum of risks and returns. <br></br>If you are still convinced you would like to dip a toe into crypto, you will need to decide which currency you would like to buy. There is a tonne of information online so start by reading some guides and user reviews. Usually, there will be a white paper for each cryptocurrency when it launches, explaining what it is aiming to do.<br>
      Consider the strength of the user community, the quality of the technology and team behind the crypto asset, and, of course, the currency's price performance to date. Will it last? What do you believe will cause future price movements? If in doubt, start small with one of the more established cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin - read our guide to it here. Keep your wits about you and, before you buy, educate yourself on cryptocurrency frauds.</p><br></br>
    <h2>What to Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrency</h2><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Timing Is Everything</li><br>
      <p>Digital assets are extremely volatile â€” and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" style="color:#ffa500">Etherium</a> can fluctuate wildly with little notice. Generally, crypto investors try to "buy the dip," meaning that they'll purchase more of an altcoin when its price falls.<br>
      Digital assets are very volatile, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may change dramatically and unexpectedly. By and large, cryptocurrency investors want to <a href="https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-gb/trading-guides/buying-the-dip#:~:text=buying%20the%20dip%3F-,What%20is%20buying%20the%20dip%3F,rise%20again%20following%20the%20dip.https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-gb/trading-guides/buying-the-dip#:~:text=buying%20the%20dip%3F-,What%20is%20buying%20the%20dip%3F,rise%20again%20following%20the%20dip.

      </p>
      <li> Watch Out for Scammers</li><br>
      <p>There may be a lot of buzz on social media about an investing technique that promises large profits from obscure crypto assets. Others make exaggerated predictions regarding Bitcoin's price growth. Unfortunately, there are some dishonest people in the cryptocurrency sector, and billions of dollars have been lost to <a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme#:~:text=A%20Ponzi%20scheme%20is%20an,with%20little%20or%20no%20risk.&text=Instead%2C%20they%20use%20it%20to,may%20keep%20some%20for%20themselves" style="color:#ffa500">Ponzi schemes</a> other exit scams.

      <li>Build an Investment Strategy</li><br>
      <p>Popular cryptocurrencies' prices can climb rapidly and quickly during a bull market. Proceed with caution  investing in BTC at high prices might result in significant losses if it is corrected.</p><br>
      <li>Lookout of FOMO (Fear Of MissingOut)</li><br>
      <p>Successful investors create a strategy for their bitcoin holdings. This can include placing a limit order, which implies their Bitcoin will be sold automatically if prices reach a specified amount. Some cryptocurrency exchanges also allow you to mimic the actions of experienced traders in the cryptocurrency market. CoinMarketCap and DataDash have collaborated to create a swing trading guide for cryptocurrencies, which you can find <a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme#:~:text=A%20Ponzi%20scheme%20is%20an,with%20little%20or%20no%20risk.&text=Instead%2C%20they%20use%20it%20to,may%20keep%20some%20for%20themselves" style="color:#ffa500">Ponzi schemes</a> other exit scams.

      <li>Pick a Good Crypto Exchange</li><br>
      <p>3 aspects to consider before choosing a cryptocurrencies exchanges:<br></br>
        1-Security:<br></br>I began with security since it is by far the most critical aspect of an exchange. If an exchange is insecure, your cash may be stolen, rendering any other benefits null and void. Nobody likes to lose money, so keep the following points in mind.<br></br>
        2-Legal aspects:<br></br>It is recommended that you use an exchange based in the same country as you are, since this will assist you in complying with regulatory changes. However, it is also possible to make use of other exchanges in other countries. It's worth noting that certain exchanges only support a limited number of countries.<br></br>
        3-Liquidity:<br></br>The greater the trade volume, the more liquid the particular exchange. Liquidity enables transactions to be completed more quickly, more conveniently, and without regard for price fluctuation. Additionally, check to see whether an exchange provides "locked-in" pricing, which assures you the price at the time of your transaction regardless of whether it settles promptly.<br>
        Bear in mind that liquidity levels for various trading pairs may vary. It might be high in the case of BTC/EUR, but low in the case of BTC/GBP. Here you can see which exchanges have the largest trade volumes.<br></br>

      <li>Identify the coin or token you wish to buy and swap the deposited funds with the desired cryptocurrency. You can also buy BTC, ETH or USDT with the deposited fiat currency before swapping these cryptocurrencies with your desired coin or token.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h2> Strategies of investing in crypto</h2><br></br>
    <ol>
      <li>Strategy 1 (buy and hold strategy) </li><br>
      <p> The best crypto investment approach is to purchase and hold. Many crypto investors call this approach 'HODL'<br>
        HODLing means buying a digital asset and keeping it in your digital wallet for a long time. Choosing the buy and hold method means you won't be trading much bitcoin. You just purchase coins and store them.<br>
        If you don't intend on selling any of your assets for years, the HODL method may be right for you, especially if you're aiming to establish a nest egg for your kids.
        </p><br>
      <li>Strategy 2 (earning a yield) </li><br>
      <p>Another common way to invest in crypto is to "earn a yield." Using this strategy, you buy crypto and then hold on to it for a set amount of time to make money.<br></br>
        In order to earn a yield, you only keep your crypto for a certain amount of time. In order to HODL, you keep your crypto for a long time. Buy coins at one price and then sell them for more money.<br></br>
        A good thing about this investing strategy is that you can often make money while you own things. This is like how a savings account pays you interest on your balance.</p>
        <li>Strategy 3 (Dollar cost averaging)</li><br>
        <p>It involves investing set sums of money into cryptocurrency at regular periods.<br></br>
          This technique relies on the fact that the crypto market is volatile, making timing difficult. Investing modest sums regularly should potentially reduce risk while increasing market exposure.<br></br>
          Dollar cost averaging spreads your assets over time to protect you from price fluctuations. That implies your investment will pay off over time.
          </p><br>`
          <li>Strategy 4 ( Value Investing)</li><br></br>
          <p>Most assets are undervalued, meaning their real value is more than what they are trading for. If you've heard of investor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/?sh=7f478f7a4639" style="color:#ffa500">Warren Buffet</a>, he's the man who popularised value investing.<br>
            Value investing is all about identifying undervalued assets. You'd then buy the asset, expecting it to appreciate in value over time. The main problem is determining whether assets are really cheap. Profiting from this method needs a lot of study and experience.
