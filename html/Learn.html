  <p class="par1">Currencies are used and recognized all around the world and differ from a country or a continent to another which enables people to trade goods and different services or in simple words it is a system of money in a certain country(method of payment).<br> Traditional or normal currencies are managed in  a centralised hub-and-spoke system  and managed by a recognized government entity while people may be unable to get greater control over their finances and privacy with such intermediates(government).</p>

   <h2>What are cryptocurrencies</h2><br>
   <p class="par2">A cryptocurrency is a type of digital  money or a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-currency.asp" style="color:#ffa500" >virtual currency</a> created from code. They function autonomously, outside of traditional banking and government systems, unlike the current traditional currency the government is then theoretically unable to interfere or manipulate them. Cryptocurrencies are created created using <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cryptography" style="color:#ffa500">cryptography</a> or a computer code and they are offering Transparency, decentralisation, immutability based on the <a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain" style="color:#ffa500" >Blockchain</a><br>
   Cryptocurrencies are wholly digital, so there is no physical coin or bill connected to the crypto you own. Instead, owners hold cryptocurrency in a digital wallet, and buy or sell through an online exchange.</p> 
   <h2>Different types of crypto fall into 4 categories:</h2><br>
   <ol>
    <li>Coins, which can include Bitcoin and altcoins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies).Coins, like Bitcoin and Litecoin, are built on their own blockchain and are a store of value, meant to be used as money. The term "altcoin" is used to describe any blockchain-based cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin.</li>
    <li>Tokens, which are programmable assets that live within the blockchain of a given platform. Tokens are built on top of an existing blockchain. They can be used to represent other things of value, like points, coins, or even a piece of art. <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-bat-crypto/" style="color:#ffa500">Basic Attention Token</a>, or <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-bat-crypto/" style="color:#ffa500">BAT</a>, is one type of token.</li>
    <li>A meme or a joke coin. These were made just for fun, and now they are worth millions of dollars. For example, the name Dogelon Mars (ELON) was made up as a joke. It is supposed to make "InterPlanetary Money Transactions" easier when it is possible. Coinmarketcap.com says it has a market value of more than $500 million as of December 13.</li>
   </ol><br>
   <h2>How are cryptocurrencies used </h2><br>
   <p class="par3">
    There are thousands of cryptocurrencies around the world where the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. a list of all transactions that has been updated and is retained by currency holders.<br> 
    Cryptocurrencies may be acquired using traditional currency such as the pound and then used to purchase an ever-expanding range of everyday products and services. Cryptocurrencies have the same value in every country, making international transactions easy while eliminating exchange rate fluctuations.
    </p>
    <h2>So is it legal? </h2><br>
    <p class="par4">The U.S. government allows cryptocurrency, but you are required to pay taxes on your investment profits. However, a small number of countries, such as Pakistan, have banned cryptocurrency. One of the reasons that many countries have banned crypto and the misleading part for crypto investors is that  Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, and dealing in them without a good understanding  of market dynamics, like with many other assets, may be dangerous. Advertising, particularly that pushing certain crypto items or firms, might lead to users trade rashly, which can result in losses. Some governments around the world are now planning to crack down on such deceptive crypto advertising and enact new regulations to protect naive investors.
    </p>
    <h2>The value of cryptocurrencies</h2><br>
    <p class="par5">The value of cryptocurrencies used the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp#:~:text=The%20law%20of%20supply%20and%20demand%20is%20a%20theory%20that,either%20buy%20or%20sell%20it." style="color:#ffa500">law of supply and demand</a> which  is an economic study that explains the link between the supply of an item or service and the demand for it in order to assess the impact on its price. The theory states the price variations of everything that may be traded on a market.<br>
      When a coin is in low supply or there is a significant demand for it, the price rises. Those who want to purchase it are eager to compete by giving ever-increasing prices. Alternatively, if there is an oversupply of a cryptocurrency and there is no demand for it, the price falls.<br>
      Generally , the rule of supply and demand states that when demand for something increases, providers will produce more of it. Manufacturers are eager to increase output in order to sell bigger amounts and profit from increased sales. But it is difficult with most cryptocurrencies for two simple reasons: they have a limited supply and are dispersed.
    </p><br>
    <h2>The supply of cryptocurrencies </h2><br>
    <p class="par6">Supply is limited. Cryptos refer to a limit on the maximum number of crypto currencies that may be issued or traded in the market. However, not all cryptocurrencies have a finite supply on the market. There are a variety of alternative cryptocurrencies accessible to you that do not have a cap.<br></br>
      Supply is limited. Cryptos refer to a limit on the maximum number of crypto currencies that may be issued or traded in the market and the  total quantity of each cryptocurrency that will ever exist.  However, not all cryptocurrencies have a finite supply on the market. There are a variety of alternative cryptocurrencies accessible to you that do not have a cap.In the case of Bitcoin, maximum supply is 21 million. <a href="marketcap.html" style="color:#ffa500">The market cap</a>(total coins that have been mined|) is over 18 million BTC have already been mined, and the remainder are gradually being added to the overall bitcoin supply pool. But couldn't someone simply tweak the protocol to allow additional coins to be released? The short answer is no.      
    </p>
    <h2>Security </h2><br>
    <p class="par7">Blockchain is the technology that makes it possible for people to buy things with money. It's very complicated to do cryptocurrency transactions on the back end. The transactions are recorded in blocks and time-stamped. It is hard for hackers to get through because of how complicated it is. This makes the cryptocurrency pretty safe, too.
    </p>
    <h2>Future of cryptocurrencies  </h2><br>
    <p class="par7">As of right now, the cryptocurrency industry is just beginning to come into its own. There are more people in the crypto-asset business as the prices rise.<br></br>
      It all points to the same thing: Until recently, cryptocurrency was only known to a small group of anti-establishment investors, but it is now swiftly becoming a household term. Several analysts predict that the value of cryptocurrencies will rise to $5 billion by 2030, more than tripling from their current $2 billion market cap. If they don't want to get swept away by the swelling flood of cryptocurrency, investors, companies, and brands can't ignore it for much longer.<br>
